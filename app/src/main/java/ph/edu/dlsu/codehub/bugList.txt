IMPORTANT:

***
Our database is not dynamic. Meaning, if I change my name, then the name of posts that I posted would not be changed. This has bad implications.
For example, I change my name to 'Madelein' then post something atrocious. Then, I change my name to 'Eugene'. Normal people won't know the difference.
I think we need to add a settings button for users to log out, change their details, etc

General Notes:
There are some activities you do not want to revert to
Whenever you revert, there is a chance that you could revert to a previous user that just logged out
Whenever you delete an account as admin, you
Bugger off code efficiency. Do this last after general functionalities have been achieved.
Also, most of the stuff are hard coded. I suggest making it more dynamic for easier debugging.
For Some Reason, profile image is not loading in picasso. Will fix soon.

Notifications:
Doesn't work for follow and unfollow yet, because felix not finished yet
Doesn't display profile pics properly for some reason (same reason sa search)
Notifications doesn't link or isn't clickable yet

Post Activity:
Posting multiple times all at once would be considered as one post

Report Post:
(Not sure if it's a bug) You can't report on your own post

Login/ Register:
Also by pressing back, you could go back to login page
- yes kasi main yung login page

Edit Profile:
I need to place the gui for edit profile
When back is pressed in this activity and you try logging in again, it would do "your account has not been created due to it being in use to another account or smth"

Admin (fixed):
Program crashes when deleting a post. Only the first delete works (either postRef or reportsRef)
It has something to do with displaying the posts on recyclerview
