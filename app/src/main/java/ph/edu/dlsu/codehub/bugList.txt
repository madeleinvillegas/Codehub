Fix bugs below
Logout button

double tap creates double posts


Registration Related Stuff:
I think we need to use email authentication, because users could just put dummy emails and get accounts. (ex. my email was user@email.com)


Notifications:
Doesn't work for follow and unfollow yet, because felix not finished yet
Doesn't display profile pics properly for some reason (same reason sa search)
    - Madelein: I don't think the profile pics are necessary for displaying notifications
Notifications doesn't link or isn't clickable yet

IMPORTANT:
***
Our database is not dynamic. Meaning, if I change my name, then the name of posts that I posted would not be changed. This has bad implications.
For example, I change my name to 'Madelein' then post something atrocious. Then, I change my name to 'Eugene'. Normal people won't know the difference.
I think we need to add a settings button for users to log out, change their details, etc



Feature Related Stuff:
Make Buttons looks more like buttons. I don't think the user would recognize our buttons.

General Notes:
When using progress dialog, disable user functionality

There are some activities you do not want to revert to
Whenever you revert, there is a chance that you could revert to a previous user that just logged out
Bugger off code efficiency. Do this last after general functionalities have been achieved.
Also, most of the stuff are hard coded. I suggest making it more modularized for easier debugging.


Edit Profile:
I need to place the gui for edit profile
When back is pressed in this activity and you try logging in again, it would do "your account has not been created due to it being in use to another account or smth"


Resolved:
    Admin:
    Program crashes when deleting a post. Only the first delete works (either postRef or reportsRef)
    It has something to do with displaying the posts on recyclerview

    Report Post:
    (Not sure if it's a bug) You can't report on your own post

    Login/ Register:
    Also by pressing back, you could go back to login page
    - yes kasi main yung login page

    Post Activity:
    Posting multiple times all at once would be considered as one post
