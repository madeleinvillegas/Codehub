General Note:
There are some activities you do not want to revert to



Login/ Register:
Even if you don't register, it automatically logs you in (maybe because of session cookies)
- there's a chunk of code sa loginactivity that automatically logs you in but you should be registered
Also by pressing back, you could go back to login page
- yes kasi main yung login page
Also input name sa registration doesn't put stuff sa firebase database
- just added it

Edit Profile:
When back is pressed in this activity, it would do "your account has not been created due to it being in use to another account or smth"
