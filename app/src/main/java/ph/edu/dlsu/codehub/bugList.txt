General Notes:
There are some activities you do not want to revert to
Whenever you revert, there is a chance that you could revert to a previous user that just logged out
Whenever you delete an account as admin, you

Login/ Register:
Even if you don't register, it automatically logs you in (maybe because of session cookies)
- there's a chunk of code sa loginactivity that automatically logs you in but you should be registered
Also by pressing back, you could go back to login page
- yes kasi main yung login page
Also input name sa registration doesn't put stuff sa firebase database
- just added it

Edit Profile:
When back is pressed in this activity and you try logging in again, it would do "your account has not been created due to it being in use to another account or smth"

Admin:
Program crashes when deleting a post. Only the first delete works (either postRef or reportsRef)
It has something to do with displaying the posts on recyclerview

Regarding Recycler Views:
Why do we use object classes when we could use hashmaps? It's kinda repetitive.
