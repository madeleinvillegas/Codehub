General Note:
There are some activities you do not want to revert to



Login/ Register:
Even if you don't register, it automatically logs you in (maybe because of session cookies)
Also by pressing back, you could go back to login page
Also input name sa registration doesn't put stuff sa firebase database

Edit Profile:
When back is pressed in this activity, it would do "your account has not been created due to it being in use to another account or smth"
