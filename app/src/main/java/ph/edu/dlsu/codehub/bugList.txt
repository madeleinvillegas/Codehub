IMPORTANT:
Our database is not dynamic. Meaning, if I change my name, then the name of posts that I posted would not be changed.

General Notes:
There are some activities you do not want to revert to
Whenever you revert, there is a chance that you could revert to a previous user that just logged out
Whenever you delete an account as admin, you
Fuck code efficiency. Do this last after general functionalities have been achieved.


Login/ Register:
Also by pressing back, you could go back to login page
- yes kasi main yung login page

Edit Profile:
When back is pressed in this activity and you try logging in again, it would do "your account has not been created due to it being in use to another account or smth"

Admin:
Program crashes when deleting a post. Only the first delete works (either postRef or reportsRef)
It has something to do with displaying the posts on recyclerview

Regarding Recycler Views:
Why do we use object classes when we could use hashmaps? It's kinda repetitive.
